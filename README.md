# Context
> Oystercard Challenge.

After completing Week one challenge **[Boris Bikes](https://github.com/SarpongAbasimi/boris-bike)** at Makers, we were given the Oystercard Challenge to give us the chance to reinforce 
what you learned last week. 
The aim of the challenge is to build a more complex system which will stretch students skills in Ruby, TDD and object-oriented design.

# Focus
> Mindful engagement with these challenges can help achieve these goals:

- write code that is easy to change.
- Test-drive codebase.
- Build with objects.
